# ML_with_Sklearn_Keras_TensorFlow
This book is a personal remake of the book "Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. 
Content in this repository is for studying purposes only. 
The code files have been "rewritten" with up-to-date python code, with added markdowns and comments for easy readibility.


**Note:**
- This repository doesn't contain the data to use in the code files.
